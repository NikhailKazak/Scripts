Purpose:
This script allows one to create a python virtual environment. 
A virtual environment, also known as a virtualenv, is used to 
manage Python packages for different projects. Using a virtualenv 
allows you to avoid installing Python packages globally which could 
break system tools or other projects. You can install virtualenv using pip.

Note: 
This script is designed to function specifically on a Linux System, it will
not function on a Windows System.
